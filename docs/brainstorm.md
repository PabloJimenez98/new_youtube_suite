# Brainstorm Log

Running log of ideas, open questions, and options under consideration.
Append new entries with a date header; don't delete old ones (mark
them resolved/rejected instead if superseded).

## Open questions
- ~~What exactly does the custom model do? (task definition)~~ **Resolved 2026-08-13** — three custom models, not one: relevance-detection (transcript → per-window score), title/thumbnail CTR predictor, hook-strength scorer. See `docs/project-description.md` §2, §5.
- ~~What data will it train on, and where does that data come from?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-13** — heuristic + zero-shot-LLM bootstrap initially, migrating to market-analysis-pipeline data (public curated channels + OAuth-connected channel's Analytics/Reporting API data) as it accumulates. See `docs/project-description.md` §6, `docs/development-plan.md` M15.
- ~~Build from scratch vs. fine-tune an existing model?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-13** — hybrid per-tool: transcription/diarization/show-notes use external tools (Whisper, pyannote/WhisperX, an LLM API) as-is; relevance/CTR/hook models are custom but built on frozen pretrained encoders (BGE, SigLIP-2), not trained from scratch. See `docs/project-description.md` §5.
- ~~What does "success" look like for a first version?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-13** — see "v1 Definition of Done" in `docs/development-plan.md` (M0–M14).

## 2026-08-13 — Phase 1–4 brainstorm complete
Full scope → research → spec → dev-plan cycle done for v1. Outputs:
- `docs/decisions/v1-scope.md` — Phase 1 scope
- `docs/research/bibliography.md` (+ 5 supporting files) — Phase 2 research
- `docs/project-description.md` — Phase 3 full spec
- `docs/development-plan.md` — Phase 4 milestone plan
New open item raised during Phase 3, not yet resolved: whether the
hook-strength scorer should ever take audio/video input (currently
assumed text-only for consistency with the relevance model, but this
was an inferred call, not an explicit decision).
